Deck - container
Create a container “Deck” that represents a collection of values like a deck of cards.
The class Deck must be able to contain elements of any one type. (e.g. Deck<int> would be
a collection of int values)
The class must fulfill the following criteria:
- Is a C++ container, as described in
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Container
- Has the following member functions:
- top():
- Returns the “top” value of the deck
- bottom():
- Returns the “bottom” value of the deck
- draw():
- Returns the "top" value of the deck and removes the value.
- add(T):
- Adds a value to the top of the deck
- shuffle(...):
- Shuffles the order of the elements in the container
- It might be useful to be able to give parameters to this function
- The container may be implemented as an adaptor (i.e. uses another container as its
storage)
- Use of the standard library is allowed in general
